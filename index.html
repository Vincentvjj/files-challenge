		<p>Superman is so overpowered: Able to fly, bulletproof, laser eyes, and gets more OP when near the sun. He is just way too powerful eventhough it is just a fictional character</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.superherostuff.com/biographies/supermanbio.html">Superman</a> is the sole survivor of the planet Krypton. His father, Jor-El, discovered that a nuclear chain reaction was building inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton_(comics)">Krypton</a> that would soon shatter the entire world. Jor-El therefore had his unborn son Kal-El removed from the Kryptonian Gestation Chambers and affixed the life matrix containing Kal-El to an experimental vessel for travel through hyperspace. Jor-El launched the starcraft toward Earth just before Krypton exploded.</p>
